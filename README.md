Hello! This is a study project for a basic calculator made with HTML | CSS | JS Vanilla

I learned some nice concepts about how to organize better between the css classes and the Js data in the html. The functionalities for the calculator setup are simple to make work, what creates a challenge here is to format the numbers to use commas and decimals and to make it work using the interface.
